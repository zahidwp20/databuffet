    We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us. For example, when you submit your email
    address to us to show interest in becoming our customer, we receive information from a third party that provides
    automated fraud detection services to us. We also occasionally collect information that is made publicly available
    on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting
    these websites and changing your privacy settings.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">5. Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</h3>
  <p>
    We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with third parties such as
    advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and others who provide our content or whose
    products or services we think may interest you. We may also share it with our current and future affiliated
    companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, we

    maintaining our servers and our service, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing,
    credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through
    our service. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these
    third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you. We may share portions of our log file
    data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application
    developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other

    service and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers. We may also disclose personal

    sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including

  <p>

    third parties as described above.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">7. How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h3>
  <p>
    By submitting your email address on our service, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your
    participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option
    that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them,
    either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as
    much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer
    audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in
    to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for
    the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the
    same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at
    any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at
    the bottom of each email.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">8. Is the information collected through our service secure?</h3>
  <p>
    We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial
    procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your
    information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition,
    people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable
    efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes
    any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the
    standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">9. Can I update or correct my information?</h3>
  <p>
    The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with
    us. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.
    Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable
    information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable
    information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us,
    or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following
    paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on
    other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this
    Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may
    take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile
    access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account
    information at all times. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every
    record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect
    information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will
    be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored
    in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as
    appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to
    update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which
    you are a customer.
  </p>

    information collected for Human Resources purposes in order to administer benefits to workers and screen applicants.
    You may contact us in order to (1) update or correct your information, (2) change your preferences with respect to
    communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) receive a record of the information we have
    relating to you. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we
    maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such
    update, correction, change or deletion.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">11. Sale of Business</h3>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of
    all or substantially all of the assets of us or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion
    of us or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our
    business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding,
    provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">12. Affiliates</h3>
  <p>
    We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of
    this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is
    controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you
    that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the
    terms of this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">13. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
  <p>
    We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfill the purposes described in
    this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on
    our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our
    legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't
    identify you.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">14. How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
  <p>
    We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an
    order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied
    sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our
    Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such
    systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information
    (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or
    warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on the
    Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or
    managerial safeguards.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">15. Your Consent</h3>
  <p>By using our service, registering an account, or making a purchase, you consent to this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">16. Links to Other Websites</h3>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or
    controlled by us. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and such
    websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember that when
    you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing
    and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our platform, is subject to that website’s
    own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to collect information about
    you.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">17. Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    We use "Cookies" to identify the areas of our website that you have visited. A Cookie is a small piece of data
    stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to personalize the Content that you see
    on our website. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may
    not be able to access functionality on our website correctly or at all. We never place Personally Identifiable
    Information in Cookies.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">18. Advertising</h3>
  <p>
    Advertising keeps us and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that
    ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">19. Cookies for Advertising</h3>
  <p>
    Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it's really hard for an advertiser to reach its
    audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">20. Remarketing Services</h3>
  <p>
    We use remarketing services. What Is Remarketing? In digital marketing, remarketing (or retargeting) is the practice
    of serving ads across the internet to people who have already visited your website. It allows your company to seem
    like they're “following” people around the internet by serving ads on the websites and platforms they use most.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">21. Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, and/or update the Privacy Policy
    modification date below.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">22. Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>
    We may display, include or make available third-party content (including data, information, applications and other
    products services) or provide links to third-party websites or services ("Third- Party Services").
  </p>
  <p>
    You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their accuracy,
    completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect thereof. We
    do not assume and shall not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person or entity for any
    Third-Party Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third-Party Services and links thereto are provided solely as a convenience to you and you access and use them
    entirely at your own risk and subject to such third parties' terms and conditions.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">23. Tracking Technologies</h3>
  <p>Cookies</p>
  <p>
    We use Cookies to enhance the performance and functionality of our service but are non-essential to their use.
    However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you would be required to
    enter your login details every time you visit our service as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in
    previously.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">24. Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
  <p>
    We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this
    section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we
    maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">25. What is GDPR?</h3>
  <p>
    GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies
    and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">26. What is personal data?</h3>
  <p>
    Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that
    could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data
    extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions,
    genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. The Data Protection
    Principles include requirements such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way
      that a person would reasonably expect.
    </li>
    <li>
      Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.
      Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
    </li>
    <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
    <li>
      People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their
      data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="mt-5">27. Why is GDPR important?</h3>
  <p>
    GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect
    and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for
    breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data
    privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the
    requirements of this new regulation.
  </p>
  <h3 class="mt-5">28. Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h3>
  <p>
    We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. processes or stores all
    personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6
    years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service
    and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.We are aware that if you are working with EU
    customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal
    data. We got you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access to your data and
    your customers data. Our customer support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working
